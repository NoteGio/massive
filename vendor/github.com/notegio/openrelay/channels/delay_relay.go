// NewDelayRelay creates a DelayRelay that consumes from `channel` and relays
// messages to `publisher`. It also requires `sourcePublisher`, which must be
// able to publish messages to `channel`, and `sentinel` which should be a
// string that would never be a normal message from the consumer channel.
// Messages will pile up on the DelayRelay until DelayRelay.Flush() is called,
// at which point any queued messages will flush to `publisher`.
//
// Note: `channel` should be a queue based channel, not a topic based channel.
// Topic based channels process messages in parallel, and thus won't block
// until Flush() is called
